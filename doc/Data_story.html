		Correlation between different schools of thought
	</h1>

	<p>
	In philosophy, different people have different opinions. Schools of thought is the perspective of a group of people who share the same opinions.
	However, I wondered how similar different schools of thought would be. Would Plato's school of thought have more similarity with Aristotle's school of thought than others since Aristotle was Plato's student?
	</p>
	<p>
	In this project, I used data containing over 300,000 sentences from over 50 texts spanning 10 major schools of philosophy. The represented schools are: Plato, Aristotle, Rationalism, Empiricism, German Idealism, Communism, Capitalism, Phenomenology, Continental Philosophy, and Analytic Philosophy.
	(The data could be found <u><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kouroshalizadeh/history-of-philosophy">here</a></u>)
	</p>
	<p>
	After performing data analysis, we find the correlation between the different schools. The result is given by the graph below.

	We notice that most pairs of schools have similar correlation. However, we notice that communism has the least correlation with every other school of thought.
